Extended search module for Drupal 7.

Dependencies: entity API

Provides an administration interface to create "extended search blocks" that allow to search in particular fields.

3 groups of filters are possible: "Any of", "All of" and "None of".

Modules can extract filters from the "extended_search" url query parameter to alter views queries for example.
